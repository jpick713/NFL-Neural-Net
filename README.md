# NFL-Neural-Net

This neural net was used to ytain on data from NFL NextGen stats

Data was cleaned up, scaled, and encoded
Then custom loss function was made according with a cdf
Keras tuner and the functional API in keras were used to make the model
and perform hyperparameter optimization

Unfortunately I joined the contest too late, but this model worked well on test data.
